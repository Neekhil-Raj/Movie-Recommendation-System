# 🎬 Movie Recommender System

A **Content-Based Movie Recommendation System** that suggests similar movies based on user selection. The application is built using **Python** and **Streamlit**, leveraging **cosine similarity** for accurate recommendations and deployed for real-time usage.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

This project recommends movies by analyzing similarities between movie features such as genres, keywords, cast, and overview. When a user selects a movie, the system returns the **top 5 most similar movies**.

---

## 🚀 Features

* Content-based recommendation system
* Interactive web interface using Streamlit
* Fast recommendations using precomputed similarity matrix
* Easy movie selection via dropdown

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **Python**
* **Streamlit**
* **Pandas**
* **Scikit-learn**
* **Pickle**

---

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. Movie data is preprocessed and stored as a DataFrame.
2. A similarity matrix is created using cosine similarity.
3. User selects a movie from the dropdown.
4. The system finds and displays the top 5 similar movies.
